# ALEXA
I'm thrilled to announce the successful completion of my project to develop a personalized voice assistant akin to Alexa! Utilizing the functionalities of two robust libraries, SpeechRecognition and Python Text-To-Speech (pyttsx3), I've managed to craft a fully operational voice-controlled assistant directly on my computer.
